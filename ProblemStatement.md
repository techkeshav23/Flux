Problem Statement: Designing AI-Native Consumer Health Experiences

Event: ENCODE x UDGIAM – Code To Innovate In Association With: Thesys 


1. The Core Question

What does a consumer health experience look like when AI is the interface, not a feature?  Generative AI enables systems that reason, infer intent, and reduce cognitive effort. This challenge asks teams to design AI-native experiences that help people make sense of food ingredients at the moment decisions matter.


2. Background: What is an "AI-Native" Experience?
To solve this, you must understand the difference between traditional apps and AI-native systems:


Traditional Apps: Are menu-driven, form-based, data-heavy, and user-effort intensive.

AI-Native Systems:

Are intent-first, not filter-first.


Infer what matters without explicit configuration.


Reason under uncertainty and adapt responses dynamically.

Act as co-pilots, not lookup tools.

Do cognitive work on the user's behalf.

3. The Problem: The Consumer Health Information Gap
Food labels are optimized for regulatory compliance, not human understanding.


The User Struggle: Consumers are expected to interpret long ingredient lists, unfamiliar chemical names, and conflicting or evolving health guidance.


Why Existing Solutions Fail: They surface raw data instead of insight, require high-friction manual input, and treat AI as an add-on rather than the interface.


The Consequence: People are left uncertain at the exact moment they are trying to make a decision.

4. The Challenge

Goal: Reimagine how a consumer understands product ingredients using an AI-native approach. You must design an intelligent co-pilot that:


Interprets ingredient information on behalf of the user.


Translates complex scientific or regulatory context into clear, human-level insight.


Communicates uncertainty honestly and intuitively.


Minimizes cognitive load at decision time.


Note: You are not expected to build a comprehensive ingredient database or achieve scientific completeness.

5. Solution Directions
Teams may explore the following paradigms:

A. Intent-First Interaction

Users show or input ingredients using image, text, or mock data.

The system infers what the user likely cares about without forms, filters, or settings.

B. Reasoning-Driven Output Instead of listing ingredients, the AI explains:

Why something matters.

What tradeoffs exist.

Where uncertainty remains.

6. Scope Guidance
To keep the challenge feasible:


Data: Use simulated, partial, or constrained data sources.


Priority: Prioritize reasoning quality and experience design over factual completeness.


Constraint: OCR accuracy, scraping, or database scale are not evaluation criteria. The experience matters more than the data pipeline.


7. Judging Criteria
1. AI-Native Experience (50%) 

Does the system feel like an intelligent co-pilot? 

Is user intent inferred rather than explicitly requested? 

Does the interface reduce cognitive effort? 

2. Reasoning and Explainability (30%) 

Are conclusions grounded in clear, understandable logic? 

Is uncertainty communicated honestly? 

Does the AI justify why it says what it says? 

3. Technical Execution (20%) 

Clean architecture and thoughtful trade-offs.

Appropriate use of models and tools.

Stability and coherence of the prototype.

8. Deliverables & Deadline

Deadline: 5th January, 2026. To be eligible, teams must submit:


GitHub Repository: Well-documented code and system design.


Live Prototype: A web or mobile experience demonstrating the AI-native flow.


Demo Video (2 minutes): Show the journey from user uncertainty to AI-assisted understanding.

9. Anti-Goals (What NOT to build)
Do not build a database browser.

Do not dump ingredient lists or research papers.

Do not optimize OCR or scraping pipelines.

Do not add AI on top of a traditional app.

10. Resources (Optional)
Teams may use or simulate:

Open Food Facts (world.openfoodfacts.org).

Exa.ai Websets.

Generative UI (Thesys.dev).

Frameworks like n8n.
